                    From the arid Egyptian desert on a cold winter night to the wonderful venetian masquerades, an exciting and fun Circus-themed evening or just a classic Renaissance Ball, we consider that there is something for all of us to enjoy. We have everything and anything available.

                <p class="homemain">
                    There are, although some restrictions for these events. We strongly advise all our guests to follow them for the smooth running of all our events. Keep in mind that some of them might be: Over 16 or 18 years old, Vegan Menu, Late night party, a specific music genre or decorative type or certain outfit rules and the last bun not least, alcoholic drinks or non alcoholic drinks allowed.
                    <br/>
                    One last thing! Keep in mind that all our events have a limited number of spots decided by our ballroom size so we advise you to get your tickets as soon as possible because we are not able to add more seats later on.
